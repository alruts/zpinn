ASK: why is my model not converging super fast?

CHECK: why is the impedance not being approached like before?
    - Is there some reason for this?


ADD: Controllable SNR for    (add this to the dataloaders? or the bvp model?)
    - mic noise
    - spatial measurement noise

Implement smarter way to specify which data points to use (pick specific points?) # like other guys
    use fewer POINTS (3x3x2 grid) []
    preprocess (3x3 grid in the middle of sample somewhere)
    
Examine the (edge effect) on the impedance []
(is it worth it to only impose at lambda/4 away from edge and .. from corner etc.) 

EXTRA: 
    Explore exactly imposing BC (would be amazee)
    save pressure transforms for every frequency seperately (equal convergence)
        (need to create continuous a, b constants?)
                THis is possible if I only use physics and bnd loss exactly on the boundary
                    (not very keen on this)
    - use jaxopt (for potential use of LBFGS)




Experiments to run on the final system:
    - Find what number of epochs is fair to ...
    - Noise robustness
        Vary SNR in spatial measurements and mic signal
    - Test single frequency
        # what is interesting here? proof of concept?
        # how big does the model need to be?
        # Do a big hyperparameter sweep
        # test eps method vs gradient based methods
        # Test using BC loss vs not using it at all
        # effect of adding room (to all of this)
        ## Examine effect of number of data points, number of collocation points

    - Test model fitting multifreq
        # will it fit to the sample
        # essentially do similar tests as before
             
             "WHAT I EXPECT": need bigger model than single freq. obviously need more data, how many freqs are needed?
                - In real mesurements a dense amount of frequency data can be obtained, is this beneficial?
                - Will the noise in real measurements have a big impact?

    - Test on real data
